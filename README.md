# Iris Analysis Project 🌸
alysis and visualization of Iris dataset using R programming language


This project explores the famous Iris dataset using R, focusing on descriptive statistics, correlations, and visualizations.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
- 150 observations
- 3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
- 4 numeric features: Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width
- No missing values, clean and balanced dataset

## 🔍 Objectives
- Explore and describe the dataset
- Identify which features best separate the species
- Visualize trends using ggplot2
- Interpret correlations between variables

## 📊 Visualizations
- Histogram of Sepal Length
- Boxplots comparing Sepal Length by species
- Scatter plot of Petal Length vs Petal Width (with color by species)
- Faceted scatter plots (one per species)
- Correlation heatmap

## 📈 Key Insights
- Petal features are highly effective at separating species
- Setosa is clearly distinct from the others
- Versicolor and Virginica show slight overlap but are distinguishable
- Strong correlation between Petal.Length and Petal.Width

## 🛠 Tools Used
- R 4.5.0
- ggplot2
- corrplot
- RStudio

## 📂 Files Included
- `iris_analysis.R` - Full analysis script
- `*.png` - Plots generated from the analysis
- `README.md` - Project overview

## 🚀 Future Extensions
- Shiny dashboard
- GitHub Pages or hosted visualization
